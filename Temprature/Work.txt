Removed "array" iterator from vector<Temperature*> and started using vector<Temperature*>::iterator instead.
Fixed multiple functions to cleanup after this change.
Created typedef for vector<Temperature*> = typedef std::vector<Temperature*> tVec.
Created typedef for vector<Temperature*>::iterator = typedef std::vector<Temperature*>::iterator tVecIT.

Fix time saved in file. Should probaly not be saved as text as it gives some complications when trying to retrive it!
- NOTE: save time_t as its originally value and change it to char * when displaying the time

overlook the project to remmember and learn!
